Changes:
--------

LaNet-vi 3.0.1
	- Bug with Gsl/BLAS linking solved.

LaNet-vi 3.0.0
	- LaNet-vi incorporates k-dense decomposition into visualization!

LaNet-vi 2.2.3
	- New option to color the nodes.

LaNet-vi 2.2.2
	- Bug with weighted graphs corrected.
	- Thanks to Dominik Dahlem!

LaNet-vi 2.2.1
	- Bug with parameter -output solved.
	- Bug with #include's in povray_renderer.cpp and svg_renderer.cpp solved.
	- Thanks to Udi Weinsberg for both!

LaNet-vi 2.2.0 
        - C++ implementation! 
        - Core-connectivity analysis improved 
	- New connectivity analysis with Gomory-Hu algorithm
	- HTML help

LaNet-vi 2.1.3

	- Bug in names file solved, in case the names file contains nodes that do not exist in the graph.
	- Bug in coresfile option solved.

LaNet-vi 2.1.2

        - Improvements on weighted graphs algorithm.
        - Extension of cliques decomposition to every central core of a connected component.
        - Use of hashing to access the graph nodes faster.

LaNet-vi 2.1.1

	- Weighted graphs (weights are float numbers assigned to each edge).
	- Improvements on node names algorithm.

LaNet-vi 2.1.0

	- Central core decomposed into cliques. New algorithm for cliques disposition on circular sectors.
	- k-core-connectivity analysis.
	- Nodes are positioned taking into account its neighbours' positions, so that the cliques in the central core organize the deployment of the whole graph.
	- Nodes labeling.
	- SVG compatibility, with option for edges' transparency (only for Linux now).
	
LaNet-vi 2.0.4

	- Improved display of degree references
	- Solved problem that appeared when networks didn't have nodes in the first cores.
	- Solved problem when displaying all edges (they were not all shown even if edges was 1.0, reported by Duygu Balcan)

LaNet-vi 2.0.3

	- Solved stack overflow bug for big networks when computing clusters.

LaNet-vi 2.0.2

	- Resolved conflict with povray when an edge extremes were coincident (Reported by Frank E. Walter)

LaNet-vi 2.0.1

	- k-core decomposition file with (node,shell-index) added
	- Visualizer to look and zoom the generated png files. Java JVM is needed to use this feature.
	- Compatibility with Network Workbench (NWB) format (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu).
	- Version for MS Windows added
	- Improvements on input file parsing
